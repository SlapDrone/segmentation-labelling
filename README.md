Necessary assets to install, set up and run the segmentation editor

## Installation

First, you need to install Docker and Docker Compose on your computer. The easiest way to do this is to [install Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/) (~650MB). **If you are on Windows, please note the `System Requirements > WSL v2 Backend` instructions. You may need to follow these first*. 

Open the installer, check both boxes during configuration, close and log out, log back in, then accept the license agreement. The docker desktop engine should (hopefully) launch without issue.
